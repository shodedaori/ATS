Certainly! Below is a Python function that finds the missing number in a list of integers ranging from 0 to n. I've added type annotations for all variables.

```python
from typing import List

def find_missing_number(numbers: List[int], n: int) -> int:
    """
    Find the missing number in a given list of numbers ranging from 0 to n.

    Args:
    numbers (List[int]): List of integers from 0 to n with one missing number.
    n (int): The upper limit of the number range.

    Returns:
    int: The missing number.
    """
    # Calculate the expected sum of numbers from 0 to n
    expected_sum: int = n * (n + 1) // 2
    # Calculate the actual sum of the numbers in the list
    actual_sum: int = sum(numbers)
    
    # The missing number is the difference between the expected sum and the actual sum
    missing_number: int = expected_sum - actual_sum
    
    return missing_number

# Example usage:
# numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 5]
# n = 5
# print(find_missing_number(numbers, n))  # Output: 4
```

### Explanation:
- The function `find_missing_number` takes a list of integers `numbers` and an integer `n` as parameters.
- It calculates the expected sum of the first `n` natural numbers using the formula \( \text{sum} = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).
- It then computes the actual sum of the numbers present in the list.
- Finally, the missing number is found by subtracting the actual sum from the expected sum.
